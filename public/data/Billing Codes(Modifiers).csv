0025,"Calculation of anaesthetic time:  Anaesthetic time is calculated from the time the anaesthesiologist/anaesthetist begins to prepare the patient for the induction of anaesthesia in the operating theatre or in a similar equivalent area and ends when the anaesthesiologist/anaesthetist is no longer required to give his/her personal professional attention to the patient, i.e. when the patient may, with reasonable safety, be placed under the customary post-operative supervision.  Where prolonged personal professional attention is necessary for the well-being and safety of such patient, the necessary time will be valued on the same basis as indicated above for the anaesthetic time.  The anaesthesiologist/anaesthetist must show on his/her account the exact anaesthetic time, including the supervision time spent with the patient."
